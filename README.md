## Hey there, I'm Dibyasom, and here's How to make a CLI tic-tac-toe game.

### Before we begin, I'd like to tell you this,

<br>

> You've perfect knowledege of your shortcomings, and imperfect knowledge of their acievements, don't compare yourself yet.

<br>

### Ps.

Configure your workspace, If you're on<br>

- Linux, you're good to go just make sure `gcc` is intalled.
- Windows, you might wanna install `Dev C++`. It can execute C codes too.
- If the prev. 2 options bring you a frown, just go with `Online GDB`, code will be identical for every platform.

<br>

### **Wait what?**

Before getting hands dirty with coding, Let's think about the logic for a while, this will make the coding phase 10x simpler, and I'm not even exagerating.<br>

<br>
 
So, where do we store the data, like the current state of the board, and what data structure to use? <br><br>
_Well, here's the tic-tac-toe board plain and simple._

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| X   | X   | O   |
| X   | X   | O   |
| X   | X   | O   |

<br>

_Now, let's look at it with the perspective of a nerd. (Yes, welcome to the world. :rocket:)_

| Row ðŸ‘‡ / Col ðŸ‘‰ | 0   | 1   | 2   |
| --------------- | --- | --- | --- |
| **0**           | X   | O   | X   |
| **1**           | X   | O   | X   |
| **2**           | X   | O   | X   |

<br>

It's superevident right, we just need to take a matrix (2D array), and store 'X' or 'O' in respective locations, and that solves the data-structure pain.

<hr>

### Lets's write the code to create a 2D array.

###### Ps, these are fully-functional code snippets without main (), by the end of this tutorial you'll be connecting the dots (or should I say functions) and make your own version of the complete code. :heart:

We will be using `malloc()` to create our arrays, cause we will be spitting the 2D-array (I might be refering to this as Matrix a lot.) accross many functions, also using the classic array declaration way is kinda nightmare.

Syntax for malloc >

```C
<datatype>* <variableName> = (<datatype of array-elements>)malloc(sizeof(<datatype>)*numerOfElements);

// If I want to declare an array 'jamesBond' with three elements of type int, here's how.
int arrSize = 3;
int* jamesBond = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int)*arrSize);
```

<br>

### Let's complicate things a bit,

Now Imagine a situation where you have `multiple arrays, being used collectively for one goal`, For instance in tictactoe board, <br>

- You could take three separate arrays, denoting each row of the board, and somehow manage those (which would be a nightmare) to represent your board, it's possible but a bad way to do it.
- Better way exists? Yes ! _*YAYY*_ !!:sparkles: <br> - Make 3 separate arrays. - Make another array which stores pointers to these arrays. - That way you can manage all the three arrays, using a single variable.(Pointer type).
  <br>

### Same stuff, in SUPER SIMPLE TERMS> :brain:

If this doesn't make sense, look at the code snippet below. <br>

- I've created a `pointer-to-pointer` type array (names `board`), (Basically every element of this array will be pointer type, and hence the `**`. :rocket:)
- Then I loop through all the elements of `board`, and use malloc to assign each of these elements an address to an array. <br>
- TADAAA, Just by using `board` variable, I can access any element of any array assigned to it. - For instance, if I want 2nd element of 3rd array, I just have to use, <br>
  `C char val = board[2][1]; //3rd row, 2nd element. `
  <br>

```C
/*
 *  Returns n*n dynamically alloted array.
 *  This 2D array will be storing the state of the board.
 */

char** createBoard(int boardSize){

    // Create an array of character pointers, each pointer will represent a row.
    char **board = (char**)malloc(sizeof(char**)*boardSize);

    // Assign a row to each pointer in array.
    for(int i=0; i<boardSize; i++)
        board[i] = (char*)malloc(sizeof(char)*boardSize);

    // Return the freshly baked board.
    return board;
}
```

Having our array declared isn't enough right, let's put some user-friendly notation to refer to each block. The board should look something like,

| Row ðŸ‘‡ / Col ðŸ‘‰ | 0   | 1   | 2   |
| --------------- | --- | --- | --- |
| **0**           | A   | B   | C   |
| **1**           | D   | E   | F   |
| **2**           | G   | H   | I   |

Now the user can just drop a character to refer to any specific cell, easy-peasy?<br>Here's the code to do that.

```C
void labelBoard(char** board, int boardSize){
    char currLabel = 'A'; // Label for cell (0,0)
                          // Rest will follow.
    // Loop and label.
    for(int i=0; i<boardSize; i++)
        for(int j=0; j<boardSize; j++)
            board[i][j] = currLabel++;
}
```

Since we're at it let's also write the code to print the board.

```C
void displayBoard(char** board, int boardSize){
    system("clear"); printf("\n\n"); //Clear stdout, and leave 2 lines.

    int unitSize;
    for(int i=0; i<boardSize; i++){
        for(int j=0; j<boardSize; j++){
            if(j<boardSize-1)
                unitSize = printf(" %c |", board[i][j]); //unitSize now holds length of string printed.
            else
                unitSize = printf(" %c ", board[i][j]);
        }
        printf("\n");

        if(i < boardSize-1)
            for(int k=0; k<=unitSize*boardSize; k++) //Printing unitSize no. of '-' makes sure
                                                     // The entire row is being covered.
                printf("-");

        printf("\n");
    }
    printf("\n");
}
```

Let's write one last utility function, which returns an array of playerNames.

```C
char** fetchPlayerIds(){
    char** playerNames = (char**)malloc(sizeof(char**)*2);

    for(int i=0; i<2; i++){
        playerNames[i] = (char*)malloc(sizeof(char)*30);
        printf("Player %d > ", (i+1));
        scanf("\n");
        scanf("%[^\n]%*c", playerNames[i]);
    }

    return playerNames;
}
```

<br>

Having done that, we just figured out 30% of the project, Kudos!

<hr>

<br>

## Well the logic is really straightforward.

- [x] Create a 2d array of size 3\*3. {More on this later}
- [x] Fill those with a to (a+9).
- [ ] Loop begins.
  - [ ] Fetch an user input whichever cell.
  - [ ] Update the cell with appropriate value accoring to player's number.
  - [ ] Check for win-condition.
  - [ ] If win-condition is satisfied >
    - [ ] Display winner, exit.
    - [ ] else, continue.

<br>

### let's start with the loop.

In simple terms, The game should run till Either player wins, or there's a draw. <br>
Hence, we're gonna use a while loop, and break (up is silent :wink:) when any of above written condition occurs. <br>

> Here's the code for that. :heart:

```C
void runGame(char** board, int boardSize, char** playerIds){
    char weapon[] = {'X', 'O'};
    int playerTurn = 0;

    while(1){
        playerTurn = (playerTurn) ?0 :1; //Swap players in every turn.
        /*
        It's same as writing ...

        if(playerTurn==1)
            playerTurn = 0;
        else
            playerTurn = 1;
        */

       displayBoard(board, boardSize); //Display current state.
       printf("%s, your turn > \n", playerIds[playerTurn]);

       scanf("\n");
       char choice; scanf("%c", &choice); //Fetch user-choice.

       // Convert character-choice to board co-ordinates, (Cus, it's more meaningful.)
       // Scroll up to fetch the character mapping.

       int alphaInd = choice-65;
       int X = alphaInd / boardSize;
       int Y = alphaInd % boardSize;
       printf("{%d, %d}\n", X, Y);

       while(board[X][Y] == 'X' || board[X][Y] == 'Y'){
           printf("It's occupied blindy. Go again, new choice? \n");
           scanf("\n");
           scanf("%c", &choice); //Fetch user-choice.
           alphaInd = choice-65;
           X = alphaInd / boardSize;
           Y = alphaInd % boardSize;
       }
        board[X][Y] = weapon[playerTurn];
    }
}

```

<br>

Okay so there's a new term `playerIds` here? Woah!? What's that? <br>
It's just another utility function to make the game kinda interactive.

Code for fetching `playerIds`.

```C
/*Returns a string array, of size 2, having names of players.*/
char** fetchPlayerIds(){
    char** playerNames = (char**)malloc(sizeof(char**)*2);

    for(int i=0; i<2; i++){
        playerNames[i] = (char*)malloc(sizeof(char)*30);
        printf("Player %d > ", (i+1));
        scanf("\n");
        scanf("%[^\n]%*c", playerNames[i]);
    }

    return playerNames;
}
```
