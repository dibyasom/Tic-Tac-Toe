## Hey there, I'm Dibyasom, and here's How to make a CLI tic-tac-toe game.

### Before we begin, I'd like to tell you this,

<br>

> You've perfect knowledege of your shortcomings, and imperfect knowledge of their acievements, don't compare yourself yet.

<br>

### Ps.

Configure your workspace, If you're on<br>

- Linux, you're good to go just make sure `gcc` is intalled.
- Windows, you might wanna install `Dev C++`. It can execute C codes too.
- If the prev. 2 options bring you a frown, just go with `Online GDB`, code will be identical for every platform.

<br>

### **Wait what?**

Before getting hands dirty with coding, Let's think about the logic for a while, this will make the coding phase 10x simpler, and I'm not even exagerating.<br>

<br>

Well, here's the tic-tac-toe board plain and simple.

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| X   | X   | O   |
| X   | X   | O   |
| X   | X   | O   |

<br>

Now, let's look at it with the perspective of a nerd. (Yes welcome to the world. :rocket:)

| Row ðŸ‘‡ / Col ðŸ‘‰ | 0   | 1   | 2   |
| --------------- | --- | --- | --- |
| **0**           | X   | O   | X   |
| **1**           | X   | O   | X   |
| **2**           | X   | O   | X   |

<br>

### Well the logic is really straightforward.

- Create a 2d array of size 3\*3. {More on this later}
- Fill those with a to (a+9).
- Loop begins.
  - Fetch an user input whichever cell.
  - Update the cell with appropriate value accoring to player's number.
  - Check for win-condition.
  - If win-condition is satisfied >
    - Display winner, exit.
    - else, continue.
